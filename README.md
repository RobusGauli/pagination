# pagination
This example shows basic pagination concept while designing RESTful API
## This is REstFul api development using JAX-RS ..
I realized that every major software employs pagination and filtering concept in their product to make it more efficient during
network calls and provide a faster response through filtering and pagination..

hence this is just a tutorial on how we can implement pagination in REstFul APi..
Note: this is maven build ..

you can get this REST framework in www.jersey.java.net

thank you
